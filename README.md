1. Introduction

❓ What is Jamboree Business Case Study?
Jamboree is a renowned educational institution that has successfully assisted numerous students in gaining admission to top colleges
abroad. With their proven problem-solving methods, they have helped students achieve exceptional scores on exams like GMAT, GRE,
and SAT with minimal effort.

🎯 Objective:
To further support students, Jamboree has recently introduced a new feature on their website. This feature enables students to assess
their probability of admission to Ivy League colleges, considering the unique perspective of Indian applicants.
By conducting a thorough analysis, we can assist Jamboree in understanding the crucial factors impacting graduate admissions and
their interrelationships. Additionally, we can provide predictive insights to determine an individual's admission chances based on
various variables.

📚 About Data:

📃 Features of the dataset:

● Serial No.: This column represents the unique row identier for each applicant in the dataset.

● GRE Scores: This column contains the GRE (Graduate Record Examination) scores of the applicants, which are measured on a scale of 0 to
340.

● TOEFL Scores: This column includes the TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) scores of the applicants, which are measured on a
scale of 0 to 120.

● University Rating: This column indicates the rating or reputation of the university that the applicants are associated with.The rating is based
on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 representing the highest rating.

● SOP: This column represents the strength of the applicant's statement of purpose, rated on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating a strong and
compelling SOP.

● LOR: This column represents the strength of the applicant's letter of recommendation, rated on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 indicating a strong
and compelling LOR.

● CGPA: This column contains the undergraduate Grade Point Average (GPA) of the applicants, which is measured on a scale of 0 to 10.

● Research: This column indicates whether the applicant has research experience (1) or not (0).

● Chance of Admit: This column represents the estimated probability or chance of admission for each applicant, ranging from 0 to 1.

❓ What is expected?

● Assuming you’re a data scientist/ML engineer hired by Jamboree, your primary objective is to analyze the given dataset and derive valuable
insights from it. Additionally, utilize the dataset to construct a predictive model capable of estimating an applicant's likelihood of admission
based on the available features.

 1. Dene the problem statement.

🎯 Key Considerations for the Problem Statement:

✔ Data-driven insights—Leverage GRE, TOEFL, CGPA, SOP, LOR, University Rating, and Research experience to determine admission
probability.

✔ Personalized prediction models—Build an AI-powered system to help students understand their chances based on their prole.

✔ Optimization of admission strategies—Enable Jamboree to rene consulting methods by identifying the most inuential factors in
acceptance decisions.

🚀 Additional Perspectives:

Comparative analysis—Determine how Indian applicants differ from global trends in Ivy League admissions.

Bias detection—Ensure transparency in prediction models to avoid biases in university ratings and recommendations.

Feature engineering—Assess whether additional variables like extracurricular activities, internships, or publication records enhance the
prediction accuracy.

Real-time prediction updates—Design a dynamic model that adjusts probabilities based on trending admission factors from past
acceptance rates.
